                Election Trackr was designed in September 2020 and updated in October 2020.
                Its purpose is to track the number of tweets about both presidential candidates.
                The rates are calculated every ~10 minutes using web scraping and a raspberry pi.
                Election Trackr cannot predict the election outcome and is not intented to influence your decision.
